# Lambda Calculus

A small project where I explore (untyped) lambda calculus.

Currently, the following things are implemented:
* An AST for representing lambda terms.
* Visitors and various algorithms:
  * Serialization to string.
  * Beta reduction.
  * Replacement of variables with some term.
  * Transforming to de Brujin indexing form.
